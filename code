CONNECTING 3PCs TOGETHER WITH A SWITCH

• Take three PCs and assign the following IPs:
PC0: 192.168.1.2 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0
PC1: 192.168.1.0 with subnet 255.255.255.0
PC2: 192.168.1.1 with subnet 255.255.255.0

• Use the ping command to check the connectivity between the three systems.
• Did PC1 reply to PC2?
• Did PC1 reply to PC3?

IN PC0(192.168.1.2) - CLI
ping 192.168.1.0 and ping 192.168.1.1

IN PC1(192.168.1.0) - CLI
ping 192.168.1.1 and ping 192.168.1.2

IN PC2(192.168.1.1) - CLI
ping 192.168.1.0 and ping 192.168.1.2

and checking it through simulation all PCs are sending and receiving packets and viceversa
